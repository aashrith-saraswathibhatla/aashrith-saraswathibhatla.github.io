I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University working with [Prof. Ovijit Chaudhuri](http://chaudhurilab.stanford.edu). My research interests lie at the interface of physics and biology, with an aim to employ physics-based approach to investigate biological processes in development and disease. My current work investigates biophysical and molecular mechanisms of cell-matrix interactions, in the context of invasive breast cancer. Please go to [projects page]('https://aashrith-saraswathibhatla.github.io/projects/') for more information.

In my PhD, I worked with [Prof. Jacob Notbohm](https://notbohm.ep.wisc.edu/) in the department of Engineering Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My PhD thesis investigated physical mechanisms of collective cell migration, a phenomenon fundamental to development, wound healing, and disease progression. Before my PhD, I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/admissions/eamtech) in Mechanical Engineering.
