I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University working with Prof. Ovijit Chaudhuri. My research interests lie at the interface of physics and biology, with an aim to employ physics-based approach to investigate biological processes in development and disease. My current work investigates biophysical and molecular mechanisms of cell-matrix interactions, in the context of invasive breast cancer. In my PhD, I worked with Prof. Jacob Notbohm in the department of Engineering Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My PhD thesis investigated physical mechanisms of collective cell migration, a phenomenon fundamental to development, wound healing, and disease progression.
